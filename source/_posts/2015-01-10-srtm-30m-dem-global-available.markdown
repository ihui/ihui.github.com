Global SRTM 1Arc second DEM are available free now through USGS DATA portal ([http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov)), which is earlier than [expect](http://www.digital-geography.com/announcement-realease-worldwide-high-resultion-srtm-data-30m/#.VLDcNyvDmSl). There are some [places](http://www.digital-geography.com/srtm-1-1-arc-second-now-available-large-global-coverage/#.VLDb5yvDmSk) not covered this time. The guy had [tested](http://www.digital-geography.com/short-announcement-quality-check-srtm1/#.VLDdYivDmSk) the quality of this dataset quickly. The result seem to be good.  
  
If you want to download the SRTM1 easily and quickly, you can go [here](http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM/) and use [wget tool](http://www.geoway.org/blog/2014/01/25/wget-in-windows/) to download. The data format is .hgt. Some guy said  
> "The 1 sec SRTM for the world (srtmgl1) are not all processed"  
  
so if you want to get more quality, you should wait for sometime
